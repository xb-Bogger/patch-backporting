## How to judge results?

After going through the validation chain that exists, the results are analyzed for correctness manually(Compare to Ground Truth(GT)).

First judge whether the generated patch **matches the logical block of code** modified by GT.(It doesn't say hunk match because there are some cases of hunk merging.)

Secondly, check that the **location** of the code change is the same or equivalent to GT.

Finally, check that the **semantics** of the modified code is equivalent to GT.
